# Real Estate Valuation Model

This repository contains a machine learning model for predicting real estate property prices. The model is developed using Linear Regression and takes into account features such as house age, distance to the nearest MRT station, and the number of convenience stores in the area.

## Repository Structure

- `Real_Estate_Valuation_Model.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the project code, including data preprocessing, model development, evaluation, and analysis.
- `app.py`: Python file for deploying the model as a web application.
- `tests.py`: Python file for testing the deployed application.
- `UCI_Real_Estate_Valuation.xlsx`: Directory containing the dataset used for training and testing the model.
- `Documentation_of_Real_Estate_Valuation_Model.pdf`: Documentation containing details of the project.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project and instructions for usage.

## Usage

1. Open the `Real_Estate_Valuation_Model.ipynb` file to explore the project code, including data preprocessing, model development, and evaluation.
2. Run `app.py` to deploy the model as a web application.
3. Access the deployed application through the provided URL to make predictions on real estate property prices.
4. Use `tests.py` to run tests on the deployed application and ensure its functionality.

## Maintenance and Updates

The model will be regularly maintained and updated as new data becomes available or improvements are identified. Users are encouraged to contribute to the repository by submitting bug reports, feature requests, or enhancements.

Please refer to the documentation within the notebook and code files for detailed explanations of each step and customization options.
