# Real Estate Valuation Model

This repository contains the code and documentation for the Real Estate Valuation Model project.

## Project Overview

The Real Estate Valuation Model is designed to predict the house prices of unit areas based on various features such as house age, distance to the nearest MRT station, and number of convenience stores. The model is built using linear regression and evaluated using mean squared error, R-squared, and mean absolute error metrics.

## Files

The repository includes the following files:

- `Real_Estate_Valuation_Model.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the project code and analysis.
- `Documentation_of_Real_Estate_Valuation_Model.pdf`: Documentation providing detailed information about the project, including data collection, preprocessing steps, model development, and evaluation.
- `UCI_Real_Estate_Valuation.xlsx`: Dataset used for training and testing the model.
- `app.py`: Deployment file for the project.
- `tests.py`: Test file for validating the functionality of the deployed model.
- `requirements.txt`: List of required Python packages and their versions.

## Instructions to Run the Model

To run the Real Estate Valuation Model, follow these steps:

1. Install the required Python packages. Run the following command:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Open the Jupyter Notebook `Real_Estate_Valuation_Model.ipynb` to access the project code and analysis.

3. Run the notebook cells sequentially to execute the code and generate the model's predictions, evaluation metrics, and visualizations.

4. Refer to the `Documentation_of_Real_Estate_Valuation_Model.pdf` for detailed information on the project, including data preprocessing, model development, and evaluation.

## Deployment and Testing

To deploy and test the Real Estate Valuation Model, follow these steps:

1. Ensure that you have installed the required packages mentioned in the `requirements.txt` file.

2. Open the `app.py` file and run it to deploy the model as a web service.

3. Use the provided `tests.py` file to test the deployed model's functionality and verify its accuracy.

Please refer to the documentation for more information on deployment and testing.

Feel free to explore the repository and adapt the code for your own projects or datasets. If you encounter any issues or have suggestions for improvements, please raise an issue in the repository.

Happy modeling!
